        <p>
            Samay’s journey into the realm of AI began during the pandemic, which piqued his interest. He subsequently secured an internship with a Silicon Valley-based AI development agency during the 10th grade. Since then, he has designed and taught his own summer course to educate teenagers in AI, which he’s been running for over 3 years.
