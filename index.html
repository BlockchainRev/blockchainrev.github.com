            My journey into the realm of AI began during the pandemic. As a person who likes to "work smart," I was intrigued in the efficiency to automate manual tasks. I subsequently secured an internship with a Silicon Valley-based AI development agency during the 10th grade. Since then, I designed and taught a summer course to educate teenagers in AI, which I had run 3 years.

            I worked at various companies, including building client projects for unicorns like <a href="https://www.revelmopeds.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revel Mopeds</a>. However, my real passion lies in creating groundbreaking AI models on the R&D side. This includes state-of-the-art computer vision models for detecting distracted driving and contributing to open-source AI research like <a href="https://laion.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAION.AI</a>. My research has been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a>, and won competitions, including competing at the <a href="https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-international-science-and-engineering-fair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair</a>.

            I was researching brain-computer interfaces to control modular robots as a student at <a href="https://www.creativemachineslab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Columbia University</a>. Currently I'm working remotely as an R&D engineer at a <a href="https://askmia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">health insurance startup</a> in California.
